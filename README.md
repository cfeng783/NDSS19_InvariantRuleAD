### A Systematic Framework to Generate Invariants for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems

A Python implementation of automatic invariant rule mining for anomaly detection in industrial control systems. It is an implementation based on the paper [A Systematic Framework to Generate Invariants for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ndss2019_07A-3_Feng_paper.pdf) in NDSS 2019, with the exception that the CFP-growth++ algorithm is replaced by CFP-growth which is easier for Python integration.


```shell
cd InvarintRuleAD/AD
python main.py
