# NDSS19_InvariantRuleAD


A Python implementation of automatic invariant rule mining for anomaly detection in industrial control systems. It is an implementation based on the paper [A Systematic Framework to Generate Invariants for Anomaly Detection in Industrial Control Systems](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ndss2019_07A-3_Feng_paper.pdf) in NDSS 2019.

The size of SWaT and WADI datasets is too large, please find them at [iTrust Labs Dataset link](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs_datasets/dataset_info/).
